      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Our policy is simple: the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute will not share your information with third parties
        without users'
        consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sanger Institute will however store the following information for purpose of evaluating our site: the domain
        name from
        which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our site, terms entered into our search engine, and
        the
        Internet address of the website from which you direct-linked to our site. This information is used to measure
        the number of
        visitors to the various sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to our visitors. Other
        information
        collected during the course of your usage of the site, such as pages visited, may be collected in server log
        files and used
        for statistical analysis of traffic patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time, the Sanger Institute may ask for further information about you (such as your name, job title,
        postal
        address, telephone, fax number and e-mail address) as part of online surveys/services. If you provide us with
        your
        information we will only use it for the purposes you designate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your information will be used to enable us to improve our website. Your data may be provided to a third party
        for
        evaluation purposes, not commercial exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an e-mail message or online form, the Sanger
        Institute will
        use this information to respond to your request. There might be times when your e-mail is forwarded within the
        Sanger
        Institute to employees who are better able to assist you. We will not retain this information for longer than is
        necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Customisation of this website requires that our server can identify the computer and web browser that requests
        data over a
        period of time. To do this, a small file is saved on the user's computer. This file contains no personal data,
        only an
        encrypted numeric identifier. Visitors' page settings are stored in a user database against this identifier,
        making it
        possible for us to save your settings without storing any other information about you.
      </p>
      <h3>Additional information held in user accounts</h3>
      <p>
        Of necessity, all user accounts are accessible to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute web database
        administrators. However
        passwords are stored in one-way encrypted format and cannot be retrieved by these administrators. This does not
        affect your
        statutory rights.
