            Surveillance is an inherently longitudinal process so sustainability 
            in the future is vital. A key focus of the second phase of the GPS project 
            (GPS2) is to establish a working system for sustainable genomic surveillance 
            with an emphasis on decentralization of data generation and analysis, especially 
            in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) where the burden of pneumococcal 
            disease is high. In view of variation in local infrastructure and resources, the 
            GPS project devises bespoke support for project partners to cater for different 
            needs in sequencing, training and mentorship.
          </p>

          <h2>Sustainable local sequencing</h2>
          
            <p>
              At the beginning of GPS2, the GPS team engaged with key partners to discuss the
              feasibility of local data generation and resources required, identifying 10
              institutes in 8 LMIC countries:

          <h2>Enhancing local capacity for data analysis</h2>
          
            <p>
              A key aim of GPS2 is to support the development of skills of local
              researchers who become confident to independently analyse genomic data.
              Supporting the development of bioinformatics expertise is achieved
              through a multi-faceted approach, through a combination of online
              training, in person workshops and ongoing mentoring.

              In 2019, collaborators from six LMIC countries joined the GPS team at
              the Wellcome Sanger institute for an intensive week focused on analysis
              and drafting of country analysis papers for publication, some of which
              have been published. Our plans for an in person bioinformatics workshop
              are currently on hold due to the pandemic. However, free

                     help me with the analysis and to address difficulties. In my opinion, it is a project
                     that goes far beyond data generation, as there is a real effort to build capacity by
                     sharing knowledge and providing bioinformatics training. During my participation, I
                     received many incentives to develop studies and opportunities to present these results.
                     I presented abstracts in the most important pneumococcus international events, the
                     International Symposium on Pneumococcal and Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD), Australia

              Nida Javaid is a PhD student from a partner group in the Department of Biology, Lahore
              University of Management Sciences, Pakistan. Nida obtained an 8 months research fellowship
              funded by Higher Education Commission in Pakistan and joined the Bentley group the Wellcome Sanger
              Institute for hands-on training in genomic analyses of S. pneumoniae. Unfortunately, Nida’s
              arrival coincided with the UK national lockdown and the switch to working from home. Despite these
              challenges, Nida quickly integrated with the team, and learnt how to apply key tools used for
              characterising the genomic epidemiology of pneumococci to datasets from South Africa and Pakistan.
              Dr. Stephanie Lo is Nida’s main mentor and together they made a great mentor-mentee team. As the
              lockdown restrictions started easing, Nida started having weekly in-person meetings with Stephanie,
              and joined occasional get-togethers with other team members.

                    “The original plan was that I will be working on the population genomics analysis of
                    pneumococcal isolates from Pakistan. However, due to the lockdown, sequencing of isolates
                    from Pakistan was delayed and I started working on the country analysis of pneumococcal
                    carriage isolates from South Africa. I started with running quality control analysis of the
                    sequenced data, followed by in silico serotyping, genotyping, prediction of antimicrobial
                    resistance and phylogenetic analysis from pneumococcal genomes using a wide range of
                    command-line tools such as SeroBA and PopPUNK. I then visualized the output using Microreact,
                    a tool that allows me to interactively explore the phylogeny with temporal and geographical
                    data. Now almost a year and a half later, this manuscript is ready for submission. I would
                    like to thank Dr. Shabbir Madhi for allowing me to work on his dataset.

                  <p>
                    After a few months, pneumococcal isolates from Pakistan were sequenced. I then analysed these
                    data using the approach and tools that I had learnt during my first few months at Sanger, and
                    am working towards publication of my Pakistan country analysis. We also presented our
                    preliminary results at the ABPHM online conference. Although I am back in Pakistan now, I am
                    still actively working with Stephanie and attend the team meetings regularly. I would like to
                    thank Stephen, Stephanie, and the team for their support and kindness. I would also like to
                    thank my PhD advisor, Dr. Shaper Mirza, for her support and guidance through my PhD.”

          <h2>Portable pipeline: reducing the bioinformatics burden</h2>

            <p>
              Ensuring quality control of sequence data and generating succinct, reliable data characterising
              genomes can be time consuming and require substantial bioinformatic training. During GPS2 a portable
              pipeline is being developed which will enable collaborators to easily input whole genome sequencing
              data and generate the in silico typing data required for downstream analysis.
